Command Used: ./addecho -d 1 -v 3 short.wav short_13.wav
Echo Delay: 1 sample
Volume Scale: 3
Original Audio File: short.wav
Modified Audio File with Echo: short_13.wav
Sampling Rate of Mono WAV File: 22050 Hz


Samples of modified file with delay of 1 and volume scale of 3:
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 18, 21, 21, 21, 21, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1]


Manual Calculation: To manually simulate the echo effect:
- An echo buffer is initialized with a length equal to the echo delay (in this case, 1 sample).
- For each original sample, the corresponding echo sample (initially zero) is scaled down by the volume scale (divided by 3).
- The scaled echo sample is added to the current original sample to create the new sample with the echo effect.
- Each new sample is clipped to ensure it stays within the 16-bit signed integer range.
- The echo buffer is updated with the current original sample for use in the next iteration.

From there the manually calculated echo samples are then converted to hexadecimal representation for comparison:

0002, 0002, 0002, 0002, 0002, 0008, 000a, 000a, 000a, 000a, 0012, 0015, 0015, 0015, 0015, 0009, 0005, 0005, 0005, 0005, 0001


They Match!
